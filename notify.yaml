# Define here where to send the "Fresh Coffee!" announcements.
# Format "Senders: Configurations: Settings"
#
# Each "configuration" can send notifications with one protocol to a single
# channel, but from multiple clients (agents). It is possible to send messages
# to several channels by defining multiple configurations. Use "test" as the
# test client ID, or "*" for all the clients. Verify message sending works (to
# "test" clients) by running `python test_sending.py`.
